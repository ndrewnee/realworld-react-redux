# ![React + Redux Toolkit + Typescript Example App](project-logo.png)

[![RealWorld Frontend](https://img.shields.io/badge/realworld-frontend-%23783578.svg)](https://ndrewnee.github.io/realworld-react-redux/)

> ### React + Redux Toolkit + Typescript codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://ndrewnee.github.io/realworld-react-redux/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://ndrewnee.github.io/realworld-react-redux/

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `yarn install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

### Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://conduit.productionready.io/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/GoThinkster/productionready/blob/master/api) which contains all routes & responses for the server.

The source code for the backend server (available for Node, Rails and Django) can be found in the [main RealWorld repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld).

If you want to change the API URL to a local server, start/build the app with the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable pointing to the local server's URL (i.e. `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000/api" yarn build`)

## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at https://ndrewnee.github.io/realworld-react-redux/

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU\* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
